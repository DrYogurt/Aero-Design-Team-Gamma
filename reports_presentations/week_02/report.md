# Progress Made

## Trade Studies
- We created a spreadsheet to test the effects a set of inputs would have on our desired outputs
- The main inputs are:
    - Weight
    - Thrust available
    - Aspect ratio
    - Wing span
    - Oswald efficiency factor
    - Cd_0
    - TSFC
- The main outputs are:
    - Max ceiling
    - Cruise range
    - Take off distance
 
## Mission Diagram
- We improved the 2D mission diagram with an animation of the aircraft following the flight path and increased readability

## Requirements
- Following the feedback given on our last progress report, we began deriving requirements based on the results of the trades studies performed

## Product Breakdown Structure
- Updated PDS to reflect new derived requirements

## Additional Work
Cabin and seat configurations have been looked into and considered

# Next Week's Objectives

## Continued Requirement Derivation
Next week, we aim to continue deriving more requirements in preperation for the SSR.
