# Progress Made

## Trade Studies
- We created a spreadsheet to allow us to perform trade studies to derive our requirements
- The main inputs of the spreadsheet are:
    - Weight
    - Thrust available
    - Aspect ratio
    - Wing span
    - Oswald efficiency factor
    - Parasitic drag coefficient
    - TSFC
- The main outputs of the spreadsheet are:
    - Max ceiling
    - Cruise range
    - Take off distance
 
## Mission Diagram
- We updated the 2D mission diagram with an animation of the aircraft following the flight path and increased readability of the diagram

## Requirements
- We began deriving requirements based on the results of the trades studies we performed

## Product Breakdown Structure
- Updated PDS to reflect new derived requirements from trade studies

## Additional Work
Cabin and seat configurations have had preliminary research done

# Next Week's Objectives

## Continued Requirement Derivation
Next week, we aim to continue deriving more requirements in preperation for the SSR
