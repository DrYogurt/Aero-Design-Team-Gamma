# Progress Made

## Product Breakdown Structure
- We began by forming an initial product Breakdown
- We then used this breakdown to begin researching requirements

## Research Topics Summary
We began researching: 
- FAA Requlations on:
    - Runways
    - Hangers
    - Weather conditions
    - Stability
    - Safety (fire suppresion and cabin dimensions)
- Comparable Jets
    - The A380 was used for many preliminary calculations, as the largest currently operated passenger jet.

## Requirements
- Since we are designing a large transport vehicle, the 14 CFR 25 (airworthiness standards for transport category airplanes) was used to determine many of the FAA requirements for the plane.
- Mission requirements were also categorized.
- Other "customer requirements" were drafted from mission requirements and regulations. These will be used to guide trade studies for the determination of design requirements.
- Requirements were drafted in the following categories:
    - Stability
    - Passenger loading
    - Weight
    - Performance
    - Operational Internal Components
    - Passenger components: Windows, seats, bathrooms, food preparation

## Weight Calculations
- Crew weight was found to be ~4,818 lbs
- Payload weight was found to be ~331,660 lbs
- Total weight was found to be ~2,233,541 lbs

## Additional Work
Mission diagram, project breakdown structure diagram and preliminary function block diagrams were created.

# Next Week's Objectives

## Continued Research
Next week, we aim to continue researching the above topics. Specific additional research includes:
- Water Storage
- Takeoff thrust determination (this will aid in specifying many engine requirements)
- Taining requirements

## Trade Studies

We aim to begin conducting the following trade studies:
- Cabin and Seat configuration
- Cruise thrust requirements
- Takeoff/Landing thrust requirements
- Alternative fuselage designs (double fuselage, flying wing, double decker, etc.)
- Wing geometry
- Fuel Efficiencies
