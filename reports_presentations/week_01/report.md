# Week 1 Progress Report

## Aerodynamic Analysis Summary

Our latest wind tunnel tests have shown promising results. The maximum lift coefficient achieved was {{ aerodynamics.lift_coefficient }}, which exceeds our initial target by 15%. The drag coefficient at cruise conditions was measured at {{ aerodynamics.drag_coefficient }}, indicating good aerodynamic efficiency.

## Performance Metrics

Current analysis shows:
- Maximum range: {{ performance.range }} km
- Service ceiling: {{ performance.ceiling }} m
- Maximum thrust: {{ propulsion.thrust }} N
- Specific fuel consumption: {{ propulsion.specific_fuel_consumption }} g/kN-s

## CFD Analysis Results

The CFD analysis reveals stable flow patterns around the wing sections. Key observations:

1. No significant flow separation at cruise angles of attack
2. Pressure distribution matches theoretical predictions
3. Wingtip vortices are well-contained by our winglet design

## Next Week's Objectives

1. Complete structural analysis of the wing box
2. Begin integration of propulsion system model
3. Validate aerodynamic coefficients with additional wind tunnel tests

## Technical Challenges

The main challenge we're facing is the trade-off between structural weight and aerodynamic performance. Our current design shows:

$$ L/D = \frac{C_L}{C_D} = \frac{{{ aerodynamics.lift_coefficient }}}{{{ aerodynamics.drag_coefficient }}} = {{ aerodynamics.lift_coefficient / aerodynamics.drag_coefficient }} $$

This L/D ratio suggests we're on track to meet our efficiency targets, but further optimization may be needed.
